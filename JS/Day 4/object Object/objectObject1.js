// B.1. (BONUS) Make your own simulation for a simple linked list custom Object
// that accepts objects with a single numeric property value in an ascending order.
// Let your object has the following functionalities
//  Enqueue a value as long as the value is in the sequence otherwise through an exception (push an item at the end of the list with the passed value).
//  Insert an item in specific place as long as the value is missing from the sequence otherwise through an exception.
//  Pop a value (remove an item from the end of the list).
//  Remove an item from specific place with the required value, if the value is not added return a message with “data not found”.
//  Dequeue a value (remove an item from the beginning of the list).
//  Display the content of the list.
//  Ensure that there is no duplication in your entered values.
//  You can add any property you need.
// Note: You can use Array Object methods and there is no need to use sort() function.
